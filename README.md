# Handwritten Text Recognition

This project provides a system for recognizing handwritten text from images.

## Description

The core functionality of this project is to take an image containing handwritten text and output its digital transcription. This typically involves a pre-trained machine learning model that processes the image and performs the text recognition.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.x installed. Depending on the project's dependencies, you might also need libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, or others. If a `requirements.txt` file is present in the repository, you can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(If no `requirements.txt` is present, you may need to install necessary libraries manually based on errors or project structure, e.g., `pip install tensorflow opencv-python`)*

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sathisathu/HandtextRecog.git
    cd HandtextRecog
    ```

## Usage

To run the handwritten text recognition and get a prediction, execute the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
python predict.py
```

**Note:** This command assumes that the `predict.py` script is configured to either:
*   Process a hardcoded image path.
*   Look for an image in a default location (e.g., `./input_image.png`).
*   Prompt for an image input within the script itself.
*   Use a default image embedded for demonstration purposes.

The output will be the recognized text displayed in your console.

## Project Structure (Assumed)

The `predict.py` script likely orchestrates the loading of a pre-trained model and then performs inference on an image. There might be a `model/` directory containing the saved model weights.
